Continuum v0.8 concepts.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:

- Nothing here may be merged into core, agent, or UI
- All logic is provisional and discardable

Purpose:
- Explore topic grouping
- Explore position vectors
- Explore comparison layouts
- Pressure-test guardrails

If this directory is deleted, Continuum remains intact.
